# free-streaming

This is a free streaming script which takes as input an initial transverse density of massless partons at time 0+. 
These partons are assumed to be produced isotropically, and hence each point is an emitter of partons which move
radially outward along a ring of radius r = tau.

The script -- which is based on the work by Jia Liu, Chun Shen and Ulrich Heinz [1504.02160] and on the work by
Wojciech Broniowski, Wojciech Florkowski, Mikolaj Chojnacki, and Adam Kisiel [10.1103/PhysRevC.80.034902] -- calculates
the components on T^\mu\nu along with the flow four-velocity u^\mu and viscous corrections \pi^\mu\nu and Pi. See the
aforementioned references for further details.
